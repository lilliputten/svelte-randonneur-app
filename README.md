## Svelte dev environment

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run start

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run start -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
